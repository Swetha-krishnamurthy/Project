My project focuses on improving the cost efficiency and security of the voting process by using consensus algorithms and smart contracts in blockchain.
Blockchain voting using smart contracts is a new and innovative approach to electronic voting that utilizes the blockchain technology to ensure secure and transparent voting. A smart contract is a self-executing program that runs on the blockchain, which is a decentralized digital ledger that records all transactions in a secure and immutable way.




Tools used in blockchain voting:
1.node.js
Node.js is a popular server-side JavaScript runtime environment,used in Ethereum voting because it allows developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain using JavaScript.


2.npm :
Npm (Node Package Manager) is a package manager that allows developers to easily install, manage, and update packages and libraries that are used in their projects.


3.Ganache:
Ganache is a personal blockchain for Ethereum development that is often used in testing and development environments.


4.Truffle:
Truffle is a popular development framework for building decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. It can be used to create, test, and deploy the smart contracts that manage the voting process.  


5.Metamask:
Metamask is a popular browser extension wallet used for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
